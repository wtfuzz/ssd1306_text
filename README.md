## SSD1306 Driver

This driver is aimed at displaying text on an SSD1306 OLED display module with minimal RAM footprint.

Data is written directly to GDDRAM and does not require a framebuffer in host RAM.

A 5x7 font is included from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/blob/master/glcdfont.c
